Desired Features:

  Put these in a test component to start:
    pop an element of the DOM and make it float when it would scroll offscreen
      try doing this with an image
    Do the same for a small element (button) without disturbing it's neighbors
    incorporate streaming video
      replace above image with video

  Stretch goals:
    incorporate login/reg and session
    include drill performance via timed completion
